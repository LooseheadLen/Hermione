3 tiered landscape:


Purpose for Each Component

Arduino:
  1. read senor input: light, humidity, temperature, moisture
  2. control equipment: light(s), misting/pumps, fan
  3. upload sensor data to BeagleBone


BeagleBone:
  1. log sensor data
  2. provide UI for user monitoring
  3. provide UI for user control

Serverside:
  TBD
  


Funtional Requirements for each Component

1. An Arduino controller can function independently without higher level controllers but it will not have the full feature set.
2. An Arduino controller can connect direct to either a BeagleBone or to the Server
3. An Arduino controller can connect to remote resourcves via ethernet or wifi
